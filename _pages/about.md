I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Toronto.

I am interested in most areas of research in computer science connected to algorithms. In particular, I enjoy tackling problems whose solutions may be tricky to discover but are intuitive and easy to understand. I am currently exploring
  - Data Structures: Splay Trees, van Emde Boas Queues, Perfect Hashing, Fibonacci Heaps;
  - Online Algorithms: Dynamic Optimality, Finance, Scheduling.

My resume is [here](files/David_Zhang_Resume.pdf).

CLRS / [Karger's 6.854 Advanced Algorithms](https://6.5210.csail.mit.edu/) Homework Solutions
======
**[6.854 Advanced Algorithms: Splay Trees Solutions [WIP]](files/6854_splay_wip.pdf)** <br>
Interesting Problems:
 - 1 d) - Proof that for \\(n \geq 4\\), any binary search tree on \\(n\\) nodes can be rotated to form any other binary search tree on \\(n\\) nodes via some sequence of splay operations.
 - 2 - An alternate amortization argument. 


**[CLRS Chapter 20: van Emde Boas Trees Solutions](files/clrs_ch20_veb.pdf)** <br>
Interesting Problems:
 - 20.1 f) - Proof that vEB trees that store clusters in hashtables use \\(\Theta(n \log \log u)\\) space.
 - 20.2 a-b) - \\(x\\)-fast tries.
 - 20.2 c-h) - \\(y\\)-fast tries.
