I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Allan Borodin](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/){:target="_blank"}.

I am interested in most areas of research in computer science connected to algorithms. In particular, I enjoy tackling problems whose solutions may be tricky to discover but are intuitive and easy to understand and explain. I am currently exploring
  - Data Structures: Perfect Hashing, Fibonacci Heaps;

CLRS / [Karger's 6.854 Advanced Algorithms](https://6.5210.csail.mit.edu/) Homework Solutions
======
**[6.854 Advanced Algorithms: Splay Trees](files/6854_splay.pdf)** <br>
Interesting Problems:
 - 1 d) - A proof that for \\(n \geq 4\\), any binary search tree on \\(n\\) nodes can be rotated to form any other binary search tree on \\(n\\) nodes via some sequence of splay operations.
 - 2 - An alternate amortization argument. 
 - 3 c) - A statically optimal (w.r.t splay trees) data structure.
 - 3 d) - Iacono's Working Set.


**[CLRS Chapter 20: van Emde Boas Trees](files/clrs_ch20_veb.pdf)** <br>
Interesting Problems:
 - 20.1 f) - A proof that vEB trees that store clusters in hashtables use \\(\Theta(n \log \log u)\\) space.
 - 20.2 a-b) - \\(x\\)-fast tries.
 - 20.2 c-h) - \\(y\\)-fast tries.
